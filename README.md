### This project is currently a work in progress

This is a continuation and completion of lasd_libraries: <br />
What is left to do:

- Graph
  - [ ] Add the calculation and assignment of CFCs to the vertices

Coming soon:

- Graph
  - [ ] I would like to add MapPostOrder (just like I did with Dfs)
  - [ ] I would like to add Fold (PreOrder and PostOrder, similarly to Map with Dfs)
  - [ ] To complete Bfs algorithm I should add dist[] and prev[]
- Implement a Double Linked List
