### This project is currently a work in progress

This is a continuation and completion of lasd_libraries: <br />
What is left to do:

- [ ] Implement a Double Linked List
- [X] Linked List
  - [ ] Add Exists()
- [X] Graph
  - [ ] Add Move and Copy constructor, Move and Copy assignment, operator=, do not implement operator==
  - [ ] Add the calculation and assignment of CFCs to the vertices

What is left to be fixed:

- [ ] Graph: make sure getTopologicalOrder() works fine

Coming soon:

- [X] Graph
  - [ ] I would like to add Map and Fold (PostOrder visit)
  - [ ] To complete Bfs algorithm I should add dist[] and prev[]
